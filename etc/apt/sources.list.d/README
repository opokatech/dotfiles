For non-standard repositories you need to install keys first.

One way to do it is to download keys into /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d directory saving them with asc
(armored ascii) or gpg (binary) extension.

Another way is to download the keys, save them in /etc/apt/keyrings directory and point to them
using signed-by directive in the .list file.
